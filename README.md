## Getting Started

First of all, it should be mentioned that there two possible modes: production and development.

### Production Mode
In order to run the server for production mode these commands have to be executed:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
After the first command all the static pages will be save as json and html files as cache files.
The second command starts the server, which is usually [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

### Development Mode
For starting the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

> **Note**
> : there is no Next.js cache functionality for development mode.

## Deployment

Both the Amplication `website`, `blog server` and `blog admin-ui`, are hosted on the staging cluster aswell as the production cluster. The repository follows a similar approach to the main amplication repository, where the staging environment will be deployed by commits to `master` and the a release - i.e., a tag of a specific commit on master - will deploy to the production environment.
