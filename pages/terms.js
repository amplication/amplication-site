                consent, and without notice or obligation to You. This Agreement
                is personal to You, and You shall not assign (or in any other
                way transfer) this Agreement (or any of its obligations or
                rights hereunder) without Amplication&lsquo;s prior express
                written consent. Any prohibited assignment shall be null and
                void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and
                inure to the benefit of each Party and its respective successors
                and assigns.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.4 <u> Severability.</u> If any provision of this Agreement is
                held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid
                or unenforceable, then: (a) the remaining provisions of this
                Agreement shall remain in full force and effect; and (b) the
                parties agree that the court making such determination shall
                have the power to limit the provision, to delete specific words
                or phrases, or to replace the provision with a provision that is
                legal, valid and enforceable and that most closely approximates
                the original legal intent and economic impact of such provision,
                and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified in
                respect of such jurisdiction. In the event such court does not
                exercise the power granted to it as aforesaid, then such
                provision will be ineffective solely as to such jurisdiction,
                and will be substituted (in respect of such jurisdiction) with a
                valid, legal and enforceable provision that most closely
                approximates the original legal intent and economic impact of
                such provision.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.5 <u>Remedies.</u> Except as may be expressly stated
                otherwise in this Agreement, no right or remedy conferred upon
                or reserved by any Party under this Agreement is intended to be,
                or shall be deemed, exclusive of any other right or remedy under
                this Agreement, at law or in equity, but shall be cumulative of
                such other rights and remedies.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.6 <u>Waiver.</u> No failure or delay on the part of any Party
                in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement shall
                operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
                exercise of any such right or remedy preclude any other or
                further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or
                remedy. Any waiver granted hereunder must be in writing (for
                waivers by you, emails will be acceptable; for waivers by
                Amplication, the writing must be duly signed by an authorized
                representative of Amplication), and shall be valid only in the
                specific instance in which given.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.7 <u>Relationship.</u> The relationship of the parties is
                solely that of independent contractors. Nothing in this
                Agreement shall be deemed to create any employment, fiduciary,
                joint venture, agency or other relationship between the Parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                16.8 <u>No Third Party Beneficiaries.</u> Except as may be
                expressly provided otherwise in this Agreement (such as
                Amplication&lsquo;s Affiliates, and licensors, and Indemnitees),
                there shall be no third-party beneficiaries of, or under, this
                Agreement, and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any
                of these terms and conditions.
